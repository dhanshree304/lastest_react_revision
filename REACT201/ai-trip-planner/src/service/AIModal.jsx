I\'ve selected hotels generally known for being more affordable.  Prices are approximate and will vary based on the time of year and booking source.\n*   **Detailed Itinerary:**\n    *   **Daily Themes:** Each day has a theme to guide your activities (South Strip, Downtown, etc.).\n    *   **Place Details:** Clear description of each location.\n    *   **Image URLs:** I have added relevant image URLs.\n    *   **Geo-Coordinates:**  Latitude and longitude for each location.\n    *   **Ticket Pricing:** Indicates if an attraction is free or provides an approximate ticket price.\n    *   **Travel Time:** Estimated travel time *between* locations.  This is important for planning.\n    *   **Best Time to Visit:** Suggestions for the optimal time to visit each location.\n*   **Budget Focus:** The itinerary prioritizes free or low-cost activities.\n*   **Transportation:** The "Notes" section suggests the Monorail as a potential cost-saving option.\n*   **Flexibility:** This is a *suggested* itinerary.  You can customize it based on your interests and energy levels.\n*   **Realistic:** The travel times and activity durations are more realistic.\n*   **Notes Section:** Added helpful tips for budget travelers.\n\n**How to Use This Plan:**\n\n1.  **Hotel Booking:**  Use the hotel information to research and book your accommodation.  Check multiple booking sites to find the best deals.  Consider booking in advance, especially if traveling during peak season.\n2.  **Transportation:** Plan your transportation in advance. The Monorail can be useful, but walking is often the most economical way to see the Strip. Ridesharing (Uber/Lyft) are also options.\n3.  **Activity Planning:** Review the itinerary and select the activities that interest you most.  Check the websites of attractions for updated hours, ticket prices, and any reservation requirements.\n4.  **Dining:**  Look for happy hour specials, affordable restaurants, and consider packing snacks to save money.\n5.  **Flexibility:**  Don\'t be afraid to deviate from the plan if you discover something new or interesting.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Prices:** Prices are estimates and can vary widely depending on the time of year, day of the week, and demand.  Always check current prices before booking anything.\n*   **Walking:** Be prepared to do a lot of walking. Wear comfortable shoes and stay hydrated.\n*   **Weather:** Las Vegas can be extremely hot, especially in the summer.  Plan accordingly and take precautions to avoid heat exhaustion.\n*   **Reservations:** Some restaurants and attractions may require reservations, especially during peak season.  Book in advance to avoid disappointment.\n\nThis comprehensive JSON provides a great starting point for planning your budget-friendly Las Vegas getaway. Remember to tailor the itinerary to your specific interests and preferences!\n',
